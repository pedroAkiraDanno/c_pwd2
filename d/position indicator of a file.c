get pointer to data in file program in c specific data inseide file. Like index pointer to page in file 









ChatGPT
To achieve this in C, you can use the fseek() function to set the position indicator of a file stream, and ftell() to get the current position indicator. This allows you to navigate to specific locations in a file.

Here's an example program that demonstrates how to use these functions to get a pointer to specific data inside a file:







In this example, we open a file in binary mode ("rb"), then use fseek to move the position indicator to byte 50. We then read 10 bytes of data into the buffer. After that, we use ftell to get the current position indicator, which effectively gives you a pointer to the specific location in the file.

Keep in mind that you'll need to replace "example.txt" with the actual name of your file, and you should handle errors appropriately in a production code.

Also, ensure that the file exists in the same directory as your C program, or provide the correct path if it's located elsewhere.
